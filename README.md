# HoneysVictoryMenagerie
Serves as master public version of my victory menagerie mod. If anyone is insane enough to want to contribute and make a MR they can do so here. 

One thing to note, I didn't invest a lot of time in setting up the project properties, so you'll need to manually edit the .modinfo file every time you do a build to correctly set up the ActionCriteria for the ruleset in use.

Feel free to add to the issues page, I know there's a few UI bugs right now, I'm not super great at that yet but I'll probably get around to them eventually.
